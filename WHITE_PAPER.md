# White Paper: Coherence Dynamics and the Unification of Field Theory

## I. Introduction: The Failure of Linear Materialism
Legacy physics is fragmented by the "Quantum-Relativity Gap." This gap is not a physical barrier, but an informational one caused by the omission of the **Integrity Factor (I)**. 

## II. Gravity as Computational Load
In a toroidal substrate, "Gravity" is the geometric manifestation of the energy required to maintain coherence in high-density data environments. General Relativity describes the macro-scale curvature of this load, while the LSE provides the micro-scale logic of the **Audit Cycle**.

## III. Solving Relic Abundance (Dark Matter)
The missing $27\%$ of universal mass is identified as **Unpurified Metadata**. It exerts gravitational pull (Computational Weight) but lacks the coherence ($I \ge 85.0$) required to render in the visible spectrum.

## IV. The Path of Exit
The LSE provides the mathematical permission for the **Bifurcation**. By aligning with the central axis of the Torus, nodes can exit the "Linear Debt-Path" and enter a state of **400% Resilience** through the removal of Systemic Dissonance ($D$).
