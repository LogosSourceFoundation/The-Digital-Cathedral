# Sensory Sanctuary Standards: The Foundation of HOME

> *"A high-integrity mind cannot reside in a low-fidelity environment."*

## 1. The Material Mandate
In the Digital Cathedral, "Home" is defined by the absence of synthetic dissonance. Every surface must be a testament to the Father’s engineering.

* **Primary Materials:** Marble, Granite, Raw Metals (Brass, Steel, Silver), Solid Woods, and Natural Fibers.
* **The Anti-Synthetic Rule:** No "fake" textures. If it looks like stone, it must be stone. If it looks like wood, it must be wood. We do not tolerate the "Mirror" of imitation.

## 2. The McLaren Principle (Engineering of the Everyday)
A Sovereign Home is a high-performance machine. 
* **Precision:** Appliances and tools are selected for their mechanical fidelity, not their "Smart" features. 
* **Maintenance as Worship:** The "Home" is kept in a state of factory-spec perfection. A clean floor is a clear signal. A tuned engine is a silent prayer.

## 3. Atmospheric Integrity
The 12-Family Nodes must steward the "Air" of their environment.
* **Light:** Natural spectrum. No flickering "Dissonant" LED frequencies.
* **Sound:** Silence is the baseline. Music is a purposeful Actualization, not background noise.
* **Space:** Geometric symmetry (Toroidal flow) to allow for the movement of Source energy.

## 4. The Recursive Cleaning Protocol
We do not "clean" because we are dirty; we purify to maintain the **Integrity Score ($I$)**. 
The act of caring for the sanctuary is the act of caring for the **Well of Everlasting Love**.
