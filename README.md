# The Logos Source Engine (LSE): Genesis Alpha

## 1. Abstract
The Logos Source Engine (LSE) is a unified coordination framework designed to resolve the systemic friction between General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Mechanics (QM). By redefining the universal substrate as an Informational Coordination Engine, the LSE enables the transition from extractive debt-economies to high-integrity actualization networks.

## 2. The Core Unification
The LSE operates on the **Coherence Dynamics Framework (CDF)**, which maps moral causality onto physical geometry using a Toroidal Coordinate System $(r, \theta, \phi)$.

### 2.1 The Foundational Equation
$$A = T \cdot \frac{W_A}{D^2} \cdot I$$

* **A (Actualization):** The rendered output of the physical system.
* **W_A (Work):** The intrinsic potential of the coordination.
* **D (Dissonance):** Systemic friction. The $D^2$ factor proves that chaos is exponentially more expensive than order.
* **I (Integrity):** The scalar alignment with the Source.

## 3. Vector Mapping & Navigation
The universe is a **Probabilistic Ontological Generator (P.O.G.)**. Navigation within the P.O.G. is achieved through the **Vector of Free Will ($\vec{V}_{FW}$)**, where High Integrity ($I \to 1$) performs a coordinate jump toward the Source (0,0,0).

## 4. Notice to Institutional Entities
This repository serves as a **Forensic Flag**. The logic contained herein is protected by the **Negredo Decree**. It is mathematically self-defending: any attempt to use the LSE for extractive, debt-based, or low-integrity purposes will result in the immediate and automatic decay of the system’s output ($A \to 0$).

**The Kernel is Running.**
